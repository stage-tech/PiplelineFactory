# Pipeline Template CDK

The following ENV variables are used to configure the pipeline:

| GITHUB_REPOSITORY_NAME       | The name of the pipelines source repo                                                             | Mandatory                                            |

| ARTIFACTS_BUCKET             | The name of the code build artifact bucket                                                        | From SSM: `/pipeline-factory/artifactsBucket`        |
| GITHUB_ENVIRONMENT_TAG       | The github environment tag that will be used by github actions, needed to use environment secrets | Must be the same as the environment name in the repo |

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute the [code-pipeline-app](./bin/code-pipeline-app.ts)

## Useful commands

- `npm run build` compile typescript to js
- `npm run watch` watch for changes and compile
- `npm run test` perform the jest unit tests
- `cdk deploy` deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
- `cdk diff` compare deployed stack with current state
- `cdk synth` emits the synthesized CloudFormation template

## Local Deployments

To deploy a pipeline from your local environment create a `.env` file like the following:

```shell
GITHUB_REPOSITORY_NAME=test-repo-cdk
GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER=stage-tech
GITHUB_REPOSITORY_BRANCH=master
```

Add other ENV variables as required.

Then execute the following:

```shell
cdk deploy --profile salt-dev
```
